My Perspective:
As a computer science engineer working for an airline company I would want to create an application that can be used across all 
types of devices so that anyone working for the company can find out any information they need to on parts related to the aircrafts.
The app would have a friendly UI that nearly any person could learn to use very quickly. 

Group Objective: 
Our groups goal would be to create the user-friendly interface. We will create an intuitive design that has a section for users to: 1.
Find information on the part they are looking for, 2. Find where the part is located on the plane, and 3. Find how quickly the part 
will be available. In each of these sections of the application the user will be able to quickly find what they need while we pull all 
the correct data when asked.

User Story #1

Mechanical Engineer
A mechanical engineer working on the plane of the company may realize that a part needs to be replaced. They would simply need to 
grab a device and load up our application. Once they type in the information for the specific part they need they can find out exactly 
how long it will take for the replacement part to arrive.

User Story #2

Aerospace Engineering Manager
An aerospace engineering manager at this company could be trying to explain to their group the part that is cracked or needs replacing 
in the plane but none of the group members could be understanding how vital it is or where it is on the plane. The manager would 
simply need to load up our app on a nearby device and type in the part and be able to show their co-workers exactly where the part is 
located on the plane.
